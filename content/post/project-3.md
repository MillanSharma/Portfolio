title: "Project 3: Road Segmentation from Satellite images"
---
This is my first mini project on a Computer Vision problem. Here the task was to take satellite with label and build a deep learning model that will segment out road from any given new satellite image.
  There are certain constrain as to where we can deploy model, for example the model is trained in images where the road network is not very dense. So if we deploy this model on the region where the road network is dense it will miss classify but if we deploy it on region where the road network is not very dense it performs well.
The idea behind this project was to study the development factor and also to study the magnitude of damage done by a natural disaster in a region.
