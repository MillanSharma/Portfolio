My first starter project was based on very common problem of prediction on titanic dataset. The data is publicly available on Kaggle. The problem statement was to predict if a passenger embarked in the titanic on April 15th 1912 survived or not. The major challenge here was the missing data imputation, because there was a lot of data that was incomplete. And the goal was to build a predictive model that answer the question "what sorts of people were more likely to survive" using passengers data like name, age, gender, social-economic class, etc.
The data is based on real incident, therefore this set an example of machine learning being used to solve real world problem.
